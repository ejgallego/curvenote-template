````{important}
Below is some background on Curvenote that we are really just using to show some features of this site! Some things to try:

- Clicking on citations will bring up a popup (e.g. {cite:t}`Cockett2022Future`)
- Clicking on a cross-reference (e.g. {numref}`Figure %s <rcmakV5jhR>`) will bring up a preview of the figure or equation.

## Curvenote

Scientific communication today is designed around print documents and paywalled access to content. Over the last decade, the open-science movement has accelerated the use of pre-print services and data archives that are vastly improving the accessibility of scientific content. However, these systems are not designed for communicating modern scientific outputs, which encompasses *so much more* than a paper-centric model of the scholarly literature {cite:p}`Cockett2022Future`.

[Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/why) sits at the intersection of scientific collaboration, publishing, and technology. We believe how we share and communicate scientific knowledge should evolve past the status quo of print-based publishing and all the limitations of paper.

The communication and collaboration tools that we are building at [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com/) are built to follow the FORCE11 [recommendations](https://force11.org/info/force11-manifesto/) {cite:p}`Bourne2012Improving`. Specifically:

1. rethink the unit and form of scholarly publication;
2. develop tools and technologies to better support the scholarly lifecycle; and
3. add data, software, and workflows as first-class research objects.

By bringing *professional tools* for science communication into the research lifecycle, we believe we can improve the collection and preservation of scholarly metadata (citations, cross-references, annotations, etc.) as well as open up *new ways* to communicate science with interactive figures & equations, computation, and reactivity.

How do we accelerate science? Improve the communication and coordination of all parts of the scientific process. Science deserves more than a PDF behind a paywall.
